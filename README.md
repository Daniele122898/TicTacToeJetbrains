# Tic Tac Toe Kotlin MPP
This repository was created for my JetBrains Internship application.

This is a MVP implementation. I sadly did not much time to invest into this so the 
"AI" isn't exactly the smartest. But it works. That's the most important part.

Before creating this i've never used Kotlin before. Same holds for the entire framework (Kotr, mpp etc..)

I only had 1 day to work on this and the documentation is somewhat lacking. But I think
it turned out fine considering all these constraints.
