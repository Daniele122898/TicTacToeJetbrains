# Tic Tac Toe Kotlin MPP
This repository was created for my JetBrains Internship application.

This is a MVP implementation. I sadly did not have much time to invest into this but I'm pretty sure the "AI" is almost unbeatable. But it works. That's the most important part.

Before creating this I've never used Kotlin before. Same holds for the entire framework (Kotr, mpp etc..)
So I had to teach myself the entire stack and code it all on the same day.

I only had 1 day to work on this and the documentation is somewhat lacking. But I think
it turned out fine considering all these constraints. Let me know if you're able to beat the AI :)

### Things that could be added
- Proper multiplayer. Technically this allows for multiple games to be run. So concurrent multiplayer shouldnt be hard to add
- Websocket implementation. This also means we can send incremental changes instead of the entire board
